# AST5220-Cosmology
This repository contains C++ templates for making an Einstein-Boltzmann solver (a CAMB like code). This is used for the course AST5220 "Cosmology II" at ITA Univeristy of Oslo. The aim of this course is for the students to learn how to do cosmology in both theory and practice by making their own Einstein-Boltzmann solver.
